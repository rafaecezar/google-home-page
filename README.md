Google Home Page

Hello everyone, this is my first TOP project (Foundation) and I'd biult the Google home page. I hope you enjoy it:

How did I do?
1. I open de Google home page and studied the code structure to have an idea, and I downloaded the Google logo (the icons I made a search for them and downloaded). Then I opened
the Visual Studio Code and started to write the code.

HTML Structure:
The HTML file structure I did with DOCTYPE html > html > head >div > body > div > /html. In the <head></head> I created a <div> where I put into the options in Google home page (Gmail, Images, the dropdown menu with the Google services and the profile icon). Then, I created the dropdown menu wich shows the Google services.
Then, I closed the <div> tag and the <head> tag.

So with the <head> tag closed, I went to the <body> tag, where I made the search bar, insert the Google logo and the "Search" and "Feeling Lucky" button. The Google logo and the search bar I grouped it into a <div> tag, and the "Search" and "Feeling Lucky" button I let into the body tag alone

CSS Structure:
The CSS file structure I basically created classes for layout the lists, text and objects (I dont have so much to say about that), so the only thing I have to say is how there are so many images and each one of them vary the size and position, to resize and positioning them correctly, I had to create many IDs, so the CSS code it's so big.

I hope you enjoy it and check out my other projects
